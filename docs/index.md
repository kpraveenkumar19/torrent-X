  Torrent X

TorrentX is a [BitTorrent](https://www.bittorrent.com) client written in Java. It implements the core of the [BitTorrent protocol](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html), allowing downloads using a single-file torrent. It also supports [magnet links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme) and saves the result to your Downloads folder.

## Features

- Downloads using a Torrent File.
- Downloads via a magnet link.
- Saves output to your system `Downloads` directory

## Installation

```bash
brew tap kpraveenkumar19/torrentx
brew install torrentx
```

## Usage

After installing (via Homebrew) the commands are available globally:

```bash
download <torrent_file>
magnet_download <magnet_link>
```

### `download using torrent file`

Downloads a single-file torrent referenced by `<torrent_file>`.

Examples:

```bash
download sample.torrent
```

Important:
- Place the `.torrent` file inside your `~/Downloads` folder. The client reads the torrent file from `Downloads` by name, e.g. `~/Downloads/sample.torrent`.
- The downloaded content will be saved to `~/Downloads/<name>` where `<name>` is taken from the torrent's `info.name`.

### `download using magnet file`

Downloads via a magnet link. A tracker URL must be present in the magnet (the `tr` parameter), and the infohash must be provided via `xt=urn:btih:<infohash>`.

Examples:

```bash
magnet_download "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:<infohash>&tr=https%3A%2F%2Ftracker.example.org%2Fannounce"
```

### Limitations

- Single-file torrents only (multi-file torrents are not supported)
- HTTP trackers only (no UDP tracker)
- Connects to the first peer from the tracker compact list; no peer rotation or retry strategy
- Expects the `.torrent` file to reside in `~/Downloads` and writes output there
